Walk them through the visuals and filters with purpose:

A. KPI Tiles

üìà 4. Business Insights Derived
From the dashboard, I noticed that COD was the most used payment mode (42.69%), and the West region had a high sales volume. The Consumer segment contributed the most to sales. Monthly analysis showed a consistent growth trend toward the end of the year, especially in December.
